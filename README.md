# Panic -- A game written during panic attacks.

## The Disorder:
*From the comments in the code:*

```
I suffer from panic and anxiety disorder. When I am having a strong
panic attack one of the only things that will make me feel any better 
is to focus on a narrow field of vision. In this case, it's my phone  screen. 

This game was / is being written to help alleviate my panic attacks. 
It might not turn out to be any good -- but that's not what this is about. 

This is about an outlet -- a focal point to channel my feeling of 
disconnectedness towards and bring myself back to reality. 
```

This descriptor was written during a severe panic attack. I was / am suffering from a severe cold and just the right combination of caffeine, cold medicine and just plain stress put me over the edge. I am currently writing from a lucid state of mind, but *I intend to reserve all the code in the game -- whatever it may turn out to be -- for instances when I am suffering from a panic attack.* This readme file will most likely be written outside of my panicked mind-state, as I find it rather difficult to spell correctly when I am having a severe panic attack. *If there are any changes to the code that are outside of a panic attack -- I will be sure to note that.*

I am hoping that this work might help someone else who is having issues with panic and anxiety. I freely admit that it will probably not make for a very good game -- it is rather difficult to program when you are having a panic attack I find. However, it does help me to calm down and focus on something other than my panic symptoms.

Most of the code here-in, I suspect, will be written on my phone in the APDE (android processing environment) application on my Samsung Galaxy Note 4. When I am feeling severely panicked, I will often hide underneath the covers of my bed and focus on my phone screen. I believe this has something to do with the agoraphobia that comes with my panic, although it is one of many symptoms I suffer:

```
- Extreme dissasociation: I don't feel connected with my body -- similar to feeling "stoned". 
- Surrealization: I don't feel like my environment is real. It's like being inside of a video game or a dream. 
- Shortness of breath / hyperventalation.
- Dizziness
- Heart palpitations / chest pain: (I often convince myself that I am 
having a heart attack)
- Numbness / tingling: often in the face, leading me to think that I may be having a stroke. 
- Exhaustion: No matter how much I sleep, I don't feel like I ever get enough and I am always looking forward to my next nap. 
- Insomnia: Ironically, I often cannot sleep when I am meant to be sleeping. 
- Lots more... I'll add them when I think of them.
```

## The Game:
While I cannot tell what my panic brain is leading me towards developing -- I know that the game will be centered around a pulsating cyan circle. I think that this is supposed to guide my breating.

I have a feeling that I'll have the circle consume other circles, kind of a agar.io -- and maybe increase in size. Again, we'll have to wait for my next panic attack to see.

# panic

From the comments in the code:

I suffer from panic and anxiety disorder. When I am having a strong
panic attack one of the only things that will make me feel any better 
is to focus on a narrow field of vision. In this case, it's my phone screen. 

This game was / is being written to help alleviate my panic attacks. 
It might not turn out to be any good -- but that's not what this is about. 

This is about an outlet -- a focal point to channel my feeling of 
disconnectedness towards and bring myself back to reality.
